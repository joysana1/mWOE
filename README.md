# Dataset
We use publicly available benchmark datasets which is  is available at the link:
https://www.kaggle.com/abhinav89/telecom-customer/data

I have uploaded the "data -Telecom_customer churn (100000).rar" here.


# Coding
1. "Baseline(RAW)-cross-validation.ipynb" is used for RAW CCP model implementation.
2. "WOE-Univariate feature selection.ipynb" is used for WOE based CCP model implementation.
3. "mWOE-Univariate feature selection-cross validation.ipynb" is used for mWOE based CCP model implementation.
4. "GAN_mWOE_privacy_1_100percent_gan_trained.ipynb" is used for GAN and mWOE based CCP model implementation.

For each model, the second cell is used for data pre-processing. For different classifiers we used diffierent cell and place a commnet for each cell.

# Result file
The excel file "evaluation measurment parameter - Graph.xlsx" represents the results and graphs of the expariments.
